//Note hence package is nothing but folder in our language
//WHY ARRAYS ARE USED 
//que = store the ages of five person which is 56,67,54,34,65 and print it
public class a95_Array {
//to store the age of five persons before knowing about array we do following
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int p1=56;
int p2=67;
int p3=54;
int p4=34;
int p5=65;
System.out.println(p1+" "+p2+" "+p3+" "+p4+" "+p5);
}
//to reduce this efforts we use array see in next code
